# FastAPI Learning Project

A few simple web applications built with FastAPI and JavaScript to demonstrate frontend-backend communication.

## Hello App

This is a simple web application with a "Say Hello" button. When clicked, JavaScript sends a request to a FastAPI backend, which runs a Python function that prints "Hello" to the console and returns the message back to the frontend to be displayed on the webpage.

## React Chat App

This is a simple chat application built with React and FastAPI. It allows users to send messages, which are then processed by the FastAPI backend. The backend can perform various operations on the messages, such as logging them or returning a response.
