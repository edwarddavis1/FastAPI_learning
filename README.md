# FastAPI Learning Project

A simple web application built with FastAPI and JavaScript to demonstrate frontend-backend communication.

## Project Description

This project consists of a simple web application with a "Say Hello" button. When clicked, JavaScript sends a request to a FastAPI backend, which runs a Python function that prints "Hello" to the console and returns the message back to the frontend to be displayed on the webpage.
