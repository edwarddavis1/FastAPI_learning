* FastAPI learning

- FastAPI: Web framework for building API apps with Python.

A hello-world FastAPI app looks like the following. 

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI() # This app object will handle all incoming web requests

@app.get("/")  # When someone visits this path, the "root" function is run
def root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

- The @app.get("/") decorator of `root()` means that when someone visits the root path ("/"), then the `root()` function is run. This is FastAPI responsing to *GET requests*, which occur when someone visists the website in a browser.
- The "/" means the main page (like visiting http://localhost:8000/)

To run this:
```uvicorn main:app --reload```

- *Routes* are used to define different URLs that the app reponds to. E.g. we need a route to add or view todo items in a todo list app.
